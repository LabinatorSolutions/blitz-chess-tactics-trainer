  <h3 class="question">Types of Chess Tactics</h3>
  <p class="answer">
    Chess tactics are short-term sequences of moves that result in a concrete advantage. 
    Understanding different tactical patterns is essential for improving your chess game. 
    Here are the most common types of chess tactics you'll encounter:
  </p>

  <h3 class="question">Pins</h3>
  <p class="answer">
    A <strong>pin</strong> occurs when a piece cannot move without exposing a more valuable piece behind it to capture. 
    The pinned piece is "pinned" to the more valuable piece by an attacking piece.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> A bishop pins a knight to the king. The knight cannot move because it would expose the king to check.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Types of pins:</strong>
    <br>• <strong>Absolute pin:</strong> Pinned to the king (cannot move at all)
    <br>• <strong>Relative pin:</strong> Pinned to a more valuable piece (can move but would lose material)
  </p>

  <h3 class="question">Skewers</h3>
  <p class="answer">
    A <strong>skewer</strong> is the opposite of a pin. A more valuable piece is attacked and forced to move, 
    exposing a less valuable piece behind it to capture.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> A rook attacks a queen, forcing it to move and exposing a rook behind it.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Key difference from pins:</strong> In a skewer, the more valuable piece is attacked first, 
    while in a pin, the less valuable piece is attacked.
  </p>

  <h3 class="question">Forks</h3>
  <p class="answer">
    A <strong>fork</strong> occurs when one piece attacks two or more enemy pieces simultaneously. 
    The opponent can only defend one of the attacked pieces, losing the other.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> A knight attacks both a queen and a rook at the same time.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Common forking pieces:</strong>
    <br>• <strong>Knights:</strong> Excellent for forking due to their unique movement
    <br>• <strong>Pawns:</strong> Can fork pieces diagonally
    <br>• <strong>Queens:</strong> Can fork multiple pieces in different directions
  </p>

  <h3 class="question">Discovered Attacks</h3>
  <p class="answer">
    A <strong>discovered attack</strong> occurs when moving one piece reveals an attack by another piece behind it.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> Moving a knight reveals a bishop attacking the enemy queen.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Types of discovered attacks:</strong>
    <br>• <strong>Discovered check:</strong> The revealed attack gives check
    <br>• <strong>Discovered attack:</strong> The revealed attack threatens a piece (not check)
    <br>• <strong>Double check:</strong> Both the moving piece and the revealed piece give check
  </p>

  <h3 class="question">Double Attacks</h3>
  <p class="answer">
    A <strong>double attack</strong> is when one move creates two simultaneous threats. 
    This is similar to a fork but can involve different types of threats.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> Moving a piece to attack an enemy piece while also creating a mating threat.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Common double attack patterns:</strong>
    <br>• Attacking a piece while giving check
    <br>• Attacking a piece while threatening mate
    <br>• Creating a tactical threat while defending your own piece
  </p>

  <h3 class="question">Deflection</h3>
  <p class="answer">
    A <strong>deflection</strong> forces an enemy piece to move away from a key square or piece, 
    removing its protection or influence.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> Sacrificing a piece to force the enemy queen away from defending a key square.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Common deflection targets:</strong>
    <br>• Defenders of important squares
    <br>• Pieces protecting the king
    <br>• Pieces blocking tactical sequences
  </p>

  <h3 class="question">Decoy</h3>
  <p class="answer">
    A <strong>decoy</strong> lures an enemy piece to a disadvantageous square, 
    often to set up a tactical sequence.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> Offering a piece to lure the enemy king to a square where it can be checkmated.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Decoy vs Deflection:</strong>
    <br>• <strong>Decoy:</strong> Lures a piece TO a bad square
    <br>• <strong>Deflection:</strong> Forces a piece AWAY from a good square
  </p>

  <h3 class="question">Zwischenzug (In-Between Move)</h3>
  <p class="answer">
    A <strong>zwischenzug</strong> (German for "in-between move") is an unexpected move inserted 
    in an apparently forced sequence of moves.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> Instead of recapturing immediately, you first give check, 
    forcing the opponent to respond, then recapture with advantage.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Key principle:</strong> Look for moves that can be inserted into tactical sequences 
    to gain tempo or create additional threats.
  </p>

  <h3 class="question">Removing the Defender</h3>
  <p class="answer">
    <strong>Removing the defender</strong> involves capturing or driving away a piece 
    that is protecting another piece or square.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> Capturing a pawn that is defending a knight, 
    then capturing the now-undefended knight.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Common targets:</strong>
    <br>• Pieces defending other pieces
    <br>• Pieces defending key squares
    <br>• Pieces blocking tactical sequences
  </p>

  <h3 class="question">Overloading</h3>
  <p class="answer">
    <strong>Overloading</strong> occurs when a piece is given too many defensive responsibilities 
    and cannot fulfill all of them.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> A queen defending both a rook and a knight. 
    If you attack both pieces, the queen cannot defend both.
    <br><br>
    <strong>How to create overloads:</strong>
    <br>• Attack multiple pieces defended by the same piece
    <br>• Force a piece to defend while also requiring it to attack
    <br>• Create multiple threats that require the same defensive resource
  </p>

  <h3 class="question">Interference</h3>
  <p class="answer">
    <strong>Interference</strong> involves placing a piece between two enemy pieces 
    to disrupt their coordination or communication.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> Placing a piece between a rook and the square it needs to control, 
    breaking the connection.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Common interference targets:</strong>
    <br>• Rook and king connections
    <br>• Bishop and target square connections
    <br>• Queen and defended piece connections
  </p>

  <h3 class="question">Windmill</h3>
  <p class="answer">
    A <strong>windmill</strong> is a series of discovered checks and regular checks 
    that allows you to capture multiple pieces or gain significant material.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> A rook gives discovered check, then regular check, 
    then discovered check again, capturing pieces on each discovered check.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Key elements:</strong>
    <br>• Alternating discovered checks and regular checks
    <br>• Capturing material on each discovered check
    <br>• Forcing the king to move in a predictable pattern
  </p>

  <h3 class="question">X-Ray Attack</h3>
  <p class="answer">
    An <strong>X-ray attack</strong> occurs when a piece attacks through another piece, 
    as if it has X-ray vision.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> A rook attacks an enemy piece through a friendly piece, 
    or a bishop attacks the king through an enemy piece.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Common X-ray patterns:</strong>
    <br>• Rook attacking through friendly pieces
    <br>• Bishop attacking through enemy pieces
    <br>• Queen combining with other pieces for long-range attacks
  </p>

  <h3 class="question">Practice Makes Perfect</h3>
  <p class="answer">
    The best way to improve your tactical vision is through regular practice.
